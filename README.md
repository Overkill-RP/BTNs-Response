# Statement of Clarification from the "Chief of Deception"

## Background

Over the past several months, there have been numerous instances of:

- Misrepresentation and false claims made publicly and privately
- Disrespectful and defamatory remarks directed at me, other developers and the community
- A breakdown in trust, communication, and professional conduct

Despite efforts to remain respectful and private, I was forced to respond after attempts were made to publicly undermine my character and contributions.

## Clarification

### On Community Trust

The community did not dissolve by accident. The mass departure of employees, developers, and trusted contributors was the result of:

- Poor leadership and communication
- Disregard for mutual respect
- A failure to maintain professional integrity
- Zero communication with your community
- DM'ing multiple staff the same "PERSONALIZED" farewell message by changing the name at the top.
- Not being a part of your community in any aspects.

### On Financial Claims

It has been falsely stated that my mortgage was paid on my behalf. For clarity:

- I never had a mortgage paid by you, I rent.
- Total compensation over 4 years of part-time collaboration was approximately **$18,000**
- This does not constitute financial support beyond fair work-for-pay standards
- You offered to pay me weekly (As you stated in your announcement), and that lasted 1 week because you screwed up and fired the other developers.
- You blamed me for the other devs being skeptical about the "AI Project", but it was your own self entitlement and equity of 65% for the "IDEA" and "MONEY" you'd put into it that cost you your full team.
- Lying to the community about why the streamers were let go, "Tariff's" is a terrible excuse, you could have put more heart and soul into it.

### On Intentions

- I never publicly aired grievances until forced to defend myself with facts and evidence
- Any communication shared with the community has been done with transparency and proof
- I have no interest in dramaâ€”only accountability and honesty
- My intent to prove that the person responsible for the downfall of Overkill RP, was not me, but you!
- For clarity, I didn't take anything from Overkill RP, we are building from scratch with a community that we actually care about!

## Final Thoughts

I once held a deep respect and trust for you, personally and professionally. That was lost, not because of a single mistake, but through repeated actions that demonstrated a lack of integrity.

In time, I hope you realize:

> Money cannot buy trust.  
> Influence does not replace respect.  
> And leadership requires more than a title.

I wish you growth and reflection moving forward.
